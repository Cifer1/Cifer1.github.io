Each week, the students tackled a different aspect of the RACECAR, accumulating different skills and learning many useful algorithms that are sure to be applicable in the real world. A challenge at the end of each week ensured that no student was lagging behind in understanding the concepts and implementations, and the final Grand Prix in the last week was a stellar opportunity for students to showcase all they had learned throughout the duration of the camp. In addition to learning about programming autonomous racecars, the intriguing guest seminars and thoughtful communications classes each week showed students how they could prepare for success in the real world, whether their interests were in becoming an engineer, scientist, or entrepreneur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Over the course of the four weeks, students were taught a barrage of technical skills that would tremendously aid their future career goals. During the first week, students were introduced to the Robot Operating System (ROS), the python programming language, and simple control systems such as Bang-Bang and PID. The knowledge accumulated throughout the week allowed them to create an intelligent wall-following racecar that could readjust its speed and turning angle to maintain a set distance from a wall based on the data from the LIDAR scanner. The second week built upon this by teaching students how to use the camera data as well. By the end of the week, students implemented programs that allowed the racecar to identify colored blobs using its ZED camera, and make driving decisions based on the colors that it detected. This gave students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with image manipulation and open source libraries such as Open CV. In the third week, students focused on learning about localization, mapping, and planning algorithms that are widely employed in the real world for autonomous navigation systems such as the one used by the Google Car. They learned the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm, and how to resolve those challenges by using a variety of sensors with different strengths and weaknesses. Last but not least, during the fourth week, students prepared their racecars for the final Grand Prix that required a combination of all the skills and knowledge accumulated from the previous weeks. This race was challenging in that not only did it require the code to be efficient and flexible, but also required the students to tireless test their programs and learn from their previous failures. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the end, the BeaverWorks Summer Institute was an immensely valuable learning experience both in terms of the educational lectures and hands-on implementation. By the end of the four weeks, students came to achieve a solid understanding of not only the technical aspects of programming autonomous vehicles, but also of how to communicate and work effectively as a team. The knowledge and experience acquired through this camp will undoubtedly benefit students throughout their entire careers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 413.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 413.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span>Figure 1. BeaverWorks Summer Institute Participants and Instructors</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><h3 class="c1 c6" id="h.wrakikrkye6a"><span>Week 1</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>In week one, we learned the basic functionality of the Robot Operating System, commonly referred to as ROS. We also learned about the fundamentals of robotics, and a few basic control algorithms in the context of robot kinematics. At the end of the week, we implemented these skills onto the actual racecar and completed a challenge.</span></p><h4 class="c1 c6" id="h.18xg8fwn4mg2"><span class="c3">Technical Goals</span></h4><h5 class="c1 c6" id="h.1hem5dot73tq"><span>Learn Basics of ROS</span></h5><p class="c1"><span>We needed to learn the basic ROS commands required to be able to</span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_56k210opzejv-0 start" start="1"><li class="c5 c1"><span>Create ROS packages and workspaces to store our programs in</span></li><li class="c5 c1"><span>Run ROS nodes (files)</span></li><li class="c5 c1"><span>Input and output data from the ROS nodes to special channels called ROS topics</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span>Detect active ROS topics and listen in on the data being transferred</span></li></ol><h5 class="c1 c6" id="h.4d5s1wg50vbp"><span>Apply Control Algorithms</span></h5><p class="c1"><span>We needed to learn about different robot control algorithms and its best use case. Then, our goal was to implement these control algorithms through code onto the racecar in order to increase accuracy of motion.</span></p><h5 class="c1 c6" id="h.jfbxhgbzeec7"><span>Complete Challenge: Wall Follow</span></h5><p class="c1"><span>We needed to combine what we learned to create a program that can follow a wall using the LIDAR sensor (laser depth-sensor). The goal is to follow the wall in as straight of a line as possible and minimize swerving, which will allow the racecar to go faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Over the course of the week, we applied the knowledge gained from the various lectures to our project. We learned how to use simulation software, such as Gazebo, to simulate a race car in a digital environment, and interact with the simulation&rsquo;s sensor readings. Then, we took it a step further and connected our computers to the actual racecar and drove it around the room. We learned how to access the readings from the LIDAR sensor and display them on our computers. The next step was learning to write a program in Python that uses ROS to communicate with the robot. All of these tasks we learned individually, while helping team members when any one of us was stuck. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling everything we learned, we wrote a wall-following program that maintains a certain distance from a wall. We use the LIDAR sensor on the car to determine the distance of the center of the car to the wall, and by calculating the difference between the current distance and the desired distance that we want the car to be, we are able to program the car to correct itself. We used a type of control algorithm called PID, which stands for Proportional - Integral - Derivative control. This algorithm allows the car to adjust its correction proportional to how far it is from it&rsquo;s desired distance from the wall. Thus, when the car turns towards or away from the wall to correct itself, it doesn&rsquo;t turn at a constant rate. Rather, the car will decrease its turn rate as it approaches the distance it wants to be at from the wall, thereby increasing the accuracy of the program and preventing the car from overshooting when adjusting itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tested the PID values in our code numerous times through repeated testing, trying to find the values that would allow the car to drive in the straightest line possible. On the last day of the week, our team had a competition with the other 8 teams to test our wall follow programs. The goal was to be able to drive through the track at the fastest speed. Because all of the cars are set to the same motor speed, the team with the most accurate PID algorithm (the one that allows the car to drive in the straightest line at the desired distance) will be the </span><span>fastest. Our team won first place in the competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h3 class="c1 c6" id="h.yo25p7n45ygw"><span>Week 2</span></h3><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span>Our technical challenge for Week 2 was to integrate the wall following control system of the previous week with a decision making algorithm. Specifically, our goal was to implement a system that approached a colored piece of construction paper, and then executed a left or right wall follow based on the color of the construction paper. If presented with a green colored sheet, our robot had to execute a right wall follow, and if presented with red, execute a left wall follow. Thankfully, we had quickly adaptable code from the week before to use for our wall follow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of the challenge came from two components: the decision itself and then the execution immediately afterward. To drive toward the paper, we applied two masks to the image feed from the ZED camera. Then, we fit a rectangle to the largests area of red and green. After determining the area, we checked if the height of the red or green blob was greater than a predetermined threshold. If the blob height met or exceeded the threshold, the robot would execute a turn and begin the wall following algorithm.There were two potential consequences, of course. If the red masked height met the threshold, the turn was leftward. If the green blob&rsquo;s height met the threshold, the turn was rightward. Also dependent on the color was the specific wall follow that was executed, since after a right turn, the wall is on the robot&rsquo;s left side and after a left turn, the wall is on the robot&rsquo;s right side. While this implementation was difficult, it still didn&rsquo;t cause the primary difficulty of Week 2&rsquo;s challenge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two of the nine teams present were successful in finishing Week 2&rsquo;s course with no crashes, and the teams achieved varying degrees of success. Some cars struggled to reach the paper, where others completed the turn and then veered off the wall suddenly after appearing to have properly executed. Reasons for this could be lighting inconsistencies in the room, red or green T-shirts worn by students, or most likely problems with the size of constants in the PID control system. Overall, delivering on Week 2&rsquo;s goals was very difficult, and few teams managed to do it correctly. However, the decision making process and logic structure experience we gained from it were instrumental in both Week 3 and the final race challenge during Week 4.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c6" id="h.skwdbq882quu"><span>Week 3</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>The technical aims of week 3 were to develop an understanding of path planning algorithms, obstacle avoidance, and localization. Unfortunately, the localization goal was dropped, and consequently the focus shifted to focus exclusively on reactionary obstacle avoidance algorithms. The week&rsquo;s challenge was a space exploration mission, in which the course was littered with obstacles and the racecar had to explore the course autonomously, dodge obstacles, and search for colored sheets of construction paper. When the paper was located, the car had to identify its color and take a picture, which it then published to a topic observable by the instructors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When presented with the technical goals for week 3, our group decided quite quickly to use a potential field planning algorithm to avoid obstacles. This decision was made because of the simplicity of a potential field from a programming perspective, since it can be implemented in roughly 8 lines of code. Our team delegated roles in which Clara and Justin worked on developing a more sophisticated and diverse blob sensing program, Aman worked on a picture sensing algorithm, Caleb wrote and adapted potential field code, and I did node integration and mathematical computations for the potential field. This way, progress could be made on every aspect of the challenge without wasting manpower, and the adaptability at the core of ROS could be utilized to bring all of the nodes together smoothly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beginning with the potential field node, we wrote a program to calculate the artificial force on the agent and perform gradient descent. The program scanned through the LIDAR&rsquo;s entire 270 degree field of view, calculating forces as it went, and consequently was too sensitive. We adjusted the program so it went through only the middle 180 degrees of the LIDAR&rsquo;s field of view, which made the car much more drivable. In addition, we set a threshold distance from an obstacle at which to activate an emergency mechanism, which reverses the car and then reactivates the potential field. This should either prevent collisions from head on entirely or drastically improve the algorithm&rsquo;s robustness. While data was not collected on this aspect, multiple instances of car adaptation after collision in the race course have shown its use. While this work was moving forward in the potential field, the blob detection algorithm from week 2 was expanded to detect multiple colors through the addition of different masks to the image published by the Zed camera. After an image saving mechanism and a publisher were added to the program, detection was completed. Then, a master node was written to create a potential field and run the detection alongside it, and the challenge program was ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tested our potential field exploration and obstacle avoidance multiple times, and separately tested our blob detection. The first time both were tested together was in the race course for the challenge event. By the end of the week, we had created an effective obstacle avoidance algorithm that explored quickly detected its search objects well. </span><span class="c3">Figure 1 </span><span>illustrates its performance relative to other teams&rsquo; programs, and shows that it outperformed other racecars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 101.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 101.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Figure 1 </span><span>is a table of the challenge event for week 3. It shows that our algorithm was comparatively more effective than other algorithms and gives data for contextualizing the performance of our racecar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h3 class="c1 c6" id="h.88wqvlehfycb"><span>Week</span><span>&nbsp;4</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>Week 4&rsquo;s challenge combined all of the technical skills that we had learned over the course of the program. We were presented with the task of navigating a difficult race course quickly and making the correct turn based on active blob detection of a colored piece of paper on the course. Our goal was to complete these two tasks in the fastest time possible, and at relatively high speeds (~ 3 m/s). We approached this problem with the potential field algorithm that had worked reliably for Week 3&rsquo;s exploration challenge. For making the correct turn, we used Week 2&rsquo;s blob detection algorithm, combined with a potential field modification for the turn itself. We also had two tech challenges, the first being making the correct turn by itself, and the second being Week 3&rsquo;s space exploration. We structured our software for the final race in two distinct nodes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first node performed our drive calculations and operation. It used the potential field algorithm that had previously been successful for Week 3, but had to be tuned somewhat for the larger, more spacious final course at Walker Memorial. </span><span class="c3">Figure 1 </span><span>shows the changes that we made between Week 3 and the final race. Raising K</span><span class="c9">P</span><span>&nbsp;yields faster speed, but can also cause oscillation in the movement of the robot back and forth. Raising K</span><span class="c9">D</span><span>&nbsp;fixes this issue, as the derivative term in PID control reacts to rapid change back and forth by stabilizing it. This was necessary, as the wide course in Walker allowed the car to weave when set to a higher K</span><span class="c9">P</span><span>&nbsp;value. We also tuned the physics aspect of the potential fields algorithm by lowering its sensitivity to perceived obstacles. Doing this makes the car less reactive to obstacles that may be blocking its path, which at high speeds means smoother operation. We found that these control values were optimal for our final race configuration. We also modified the potential field node to have a contingency for when making the correct turn is necessary. The node added a negative x-axis component to the artificial &ldquo;kick&rdquo; vector that we placed behind the vehicle to force it to move forward. The negative x component weights the car&rsquo;s direction heavily to the right, forcing a right turn. As seen in</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Fig. 2</span><span>, the right-turn vector modification shifts the net vector to the right, representing the output of the potential field algorithm/the direction of the car. We found this approach moderately successful, with an 85% success rate, approximately. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second node functioned as a color detector for making the correct turn. Our approach for this node was extremely similar to how we detected color using the OpenCV library during Week 3. This approach used color ranges in the HSV color space to detect contours on an image, showing us where the rectangular piece of paper is, and if it is the requisite color for the turn. Our specific detector used red to signify a right turn. If the Zed camera on the car saw a red piece of paper, it would send a boolean signal to our first node, which would trigger the right turn contingency. This detection worked almost too well, facing problems with the orange light coming out of the doors at Walker Memorial. We had a 30% false positive rate for the color detector, which presented problems during our time trial races. In general, however, our detector was successful and helped us finish in 2nd place overall. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Figure 1</span><span>&nbsp;shows the tuning value comparison between technical applications of our potential field algorithm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 507.00px; height: 66.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 507.00px; height: 66.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Figure 2</span><span>&nbsp;shows how our potential field node activates the turn.

Writing general code also gave us the opportunity to tweak our algorithms to be suited to the particular task. We also worked in parallel on design, not in series. While one portion of the team focused on testing pre-programmed algorithms in situ, the other portion worked on a better, more robust algorithm. This working style gave us flexibility and allowed us to finish challenges more efficiently. We learned that robots are not even close to science fiction, and that technically, robots are limited, clunky, and inefficient. Even with recent developments in supercomputing/GPU-based processing, computer vision forced us to minimize computational expense. We generally think of robots as technological panacea, but we found them to be powerful, albeit limited, tools to interact with and change the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Personal Reflections</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the intriguing guest seminars to the very informative lectures to the fun-filled communications classes, the BeaverWorks Summer Institute has truly been a transformative experience. I learned so much not only about programming with ROS and autonomous navigation, but also about how to work as a team to delegate tasks and maintain a positive environment. The people I have met here were absolutely amazing in terms of their willingness to set aside competition and help others in need, their knowledge and ability to problem solve and think critically, and last but not least their fervent love and passion for robotics and engineering. The instructors have been so patient and helpful in making sure every student was on track and knew how to implement the concepts being taught, and I could not have learned so much in such a short amount of time without their guidance. In the end, I left BWSI more inspired and excited than ever about my future in robotics.

I prepared for the course with this expectation, and grew intimidated as the time came. Once BWSI began, I realized I was pretty far off. The emphasis on project based learning and on exploratory development centralized around a task instead of instruction-solution central learning was absolutely amazing. Instead of clinging exclusively to the principles I learned before the program, I was able to use my own background and skill set to complement the focus of the course. The instructors were absolutely incredible, and while Sertac and Ken were able to help me develop my theoretical understanding of autonomy and robotics, the seminars gave us a sort of window into the more applicable side. We saw through the lectures by our JPL guests the construction of a development of a general solution to a problem, and then in our labs every day we learned the struggles of implementing it. During this program, I grew as a problem solver in designing my own solutions to problems, and learned about the process by which a problem is solved by implementing a solution with my teammates. I knew coming in that teamwork would be essential, and expected it to be fluid. I didn&rsquo;t quite expect the diversity of my teammates&rsquo; skill sets, and was lucky to have a team so talented and eager to work. As I continue to study autonomy theory and physicomimetics in the hope of designing general solutions to different classes of problems, the knowledge and skills i developed at BWSI will always be in the back of my mind. I&rsquo;ll always be asking myself &ldquo;How can we build this?&rdquo; At BWSI, we always were able to build it. Because of my time at BWSI, I understand that not only </span><span class="c10">can </span><span>a solution to a problem be created and built, but with care and motivation, a solution </span><span class="c10">will</span><span>&nbsp;be built. (Jack Messina)</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I reflect on BWSI as an experience, it feels as if MIT had given me some sort of technical wonderland in which to explore and create for 4 short weeks. The incredible resources and instruction available to me helped me become a more confident engineer, designer, and roboticist. I also take away some unexpected insight from this wonderful program. Over the past month, I&rsquo;ve learned how to shift from a modality of independent work to constant collaboration. This strategy of working in parallel, not in series, has helped me become a more effective problem solver and communicator. Walking in on the first day, I would not have expected the level of deep camaraderie I felt with my team. We quickly found each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and adapted each of our essential roles on the team. Their diverse experience and skill sets propelled us to an amazing second place finish. BWSI gave me a new lens with which to view engineering, not as a set of hurdles to overcome, but a boundless world of opportunity. Indeed, I now have the toolset requisite for innovation, given to me by numerous seminars from industry leaders and an environment well-suited for technical growth. I also thrived in the independence that BWSI provided. Learning there was a huge paradigmatic shift from the high school classroom, and a sorely needed one at that. MIT and BWSI gave me the tools, mindset, and connections necessary to succeed in engineering, and I can&rsquo;t thank anyone involved enough.
